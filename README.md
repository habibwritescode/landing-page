# Landing Page Project

- This is a project for Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree.

- I used the starter code that has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. 

- I converted this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Interactions

- Dynamically add navigation menu depending on the sections added to the page.

- When user clicks on navigation item, there is a scroll to the section rather than the default jump.

- Section actively being viewed is differentiated with styling.

- Add an active state to navigation item when its corresponding section is in the viewport.
